A Hydroponics Tower, utilizing drip system for an affordable, non-intrusive, and power efficient agricultural hot topic for venture capitalists looking into vertical farming in urban environments, the eco-friendly survivalists, and the curious children.

This hydroponics Tower runs on the Arduino Platform and collects data through Bluefruit LE, on your Android/iOS smartphones. Our goal was to track pH, TDS, and power consumption to transmit into your mobile application through Bluetooth. This project spanned over the course of three weeks, and this was what we were able to manage as a team.
